# .NET Core API Reference

## Namespaces in the .NET Core Class Library ##

The following is a list of namespaces in the .NET Core class library. Each namespace contains a set of functionally-related types.

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-condensed">
<thead>
   <tr>
      <th>Namespace</th>
      <th>Description</th>
   </tr>
</thead>
<tr>
   <td>@Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder </td>
   <td>Provides types that support interoperation between the Dynamic Language Runtime and C#.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@Microsoft.SqlServer.Server </td>
   <td>Contains classes for integrating .NET Core with Microsoft SQL Server and the SQL Server database engine process execution environment.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@Microsoft.VisualBasic </td>
   <td>
   Contains types that support the Visual Basic runtime.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices </td>
   <td>
   Contains internal-use only types that support the Visual Basic compiler.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@Microsoft.Win32 </td>
   <td>
   Contains classes that manipulate the Windows system registry.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles </td>
   <td>
   Contains classes that support safe access to Windows file and operating system handles.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System </td>
   <td>
   Contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and exceptions.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.CodeDom.Compiler </td>
   <td>
   Contains a type used to identify code that is auto-generated by a tool. 
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.Collections </td>
   <td>
   Contains classes and interfaces that define various non-generic collections of objects, such as lists, queues, bit arrays, hash tables and dictionaries.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.Collections.Concurrent </td>
   <td>
   Provides thread-safe collection classes that should be used instead of the corresponding types in the System.Collections and System.Collections.Generic namespaces whenever multiple threads are accessing the collection concurrently. However, members accessed through extension methods or through the interfaces that these collection classes implement are not guaranteed to be thread safe and may need to be synchronized by the caller.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.Collections.Generic </td>
   <td>
   Contains types that define generic collections, which allow users to create strongly-typed collections that provide better type safety and performance than non-generic collections.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.Collections.ObjectModel </td>
   <td>
   Contains classes that can be used as collections in the object model of a reusable library. Use these classes when properties or methods return collections.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.Collections.Specialized </td>
   <td>
   Contains specialized and strongly-typed collections such as a linked list dictionary, a bit vector, and collections that contain only strings.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.ComponentModel </td>
   <td>
   Contains classes that are used to implement the run-time and design-time behavior of components and controls. This namespace includes the base classes and interfaces for implementing attributes and type converters and binding to data sources.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations </td>
   <td>

    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema </td>
   <td>

<tr>
   <td>@System.Data.SqlClient </td>
   <td>
   The data provider for Microsoft SQL Server.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.Data.SqlTypes </td>
   <td>
   Contains classes for native data types in SQL Server. These classes provide a safer, faster alternative to the primitive data types provided in the System namespace. Using the classes in this namespace helps prevent type conversion errors caused by loss of precision. Because other data types are converted to and from SqlTypes behind the scenes, explicitly creating and using objects within this namespace also yields faster code.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.Diagnostics </td>
   <td>
   Contains classes that allow you to interact with system processes, event logs, and performance counters.
    </td>

    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>@System.IO.IsolatedStorage </td>
   <td>
   Contains types that allow the creation and use of isolated stores. Isolated stores let you read and write data that less trusted code cannot access, and prevent the exposure of sensitive information that can be saved elsewhere on the file system. Data is stored in compartments that are isolated by the current user and by the assembly in which the code exists. Roaming profiles can be used in conjunction with isolated storage so that isolated stores travel with the user's profile.

## Improving the Documentation ##

If you find an issue or an inconsistency, we would love to hear about it! Go to the [.NET Core docs repo](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs/ ".NET Core docs repo") on Github, and open an issue to let us know.
